1. Determine goals for 2014 election races.
  A. Get at least some candidates on some ballots in PA
  B. Get FEC recognition as a state political party: requires running a candidate for Congress

    ii. gains party name printed on voter registration forms
    iii. gains party more secure status with the commonwealth. 
  D. If possible, get some candidates elected
  E. Use campaigns to build party publicity and membership.
  F. Use campaigns as "bully pulpits" for presenting Justice Party issue positions. 

2. Determine criteria for targeting 2014 election races.
  A. Preferable to be able to stack candidates for PA legislative and lower offices with a CD candidate
  B. Preferable to run either one or maybe two Congressional candidates
    i. ideally either in greater Philly or Pittsburgh media markets, maybe both
    ii. more than two would stretch resources too thin. 
  C. The best success is likely to come where the JP candidates can be the opposition
    i. where candidates run unopposed, or against token opposition
    ii. where one party is so dominant that the other major party is an afterthought

3. Research and triage districts that best fit criteria. 

4. Seek out candidates in targeted districts. 

5. Get candidates on ballot (signature drive).
