## Goals
1. Get at least some candidates on some ballots in PA
1. Get FEC recognition as a state political party: requires running a candidate for Congress

  * gains party access to special elections
  * gains party name printed on voter registration forms
  * gains party more secure status with the commonwealth. 
1. If possible, get some candidates elected
1. Use campaigns to build party publicity and membership.
1. Use campaigns as "bully pulpits" for presenting Justice Party issue positions. 

## High-level Tasks
1. Determine criteria for targeting 2014 election races.
  1. Preferable to be able to stack candidates for PA legislative and lower offices with a CD candidate
  1. Preferable to run either one or maybe two Congressional candidates
    1. ideally either in greater Philly or Pittsburgh media markets, maybe both
    1. more than two would stretch resources too thin. 
  1. The best success is likely to come where the JP candidates can be the opposition
    1. where candidates run unopposed, or against token opposition
    1. where one party is so dominant that the other major party is an afterthought
1. Research and triage districts that best fit criteria. 
1. Seek out candidates in targeted districts. 
1. Get candidates on ballot (signature drive).
1. Maximize voter turnout for JPPA candidates.
