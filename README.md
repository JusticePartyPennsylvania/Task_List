# Task List

This is a public task list for people who wish to help build the Justice Party of Pennsylvania.  If you'd like to get started right away, head over to the [Issues] section for a list of our open tasks.  Otherwise, keep reading for an overview of how this repo is organized and how people can contribute.

# Organization
This repository is organized into two sections:  the [File Repository] and the [Issues] list.

## File Repository
The [File Repository] is the primary section of the repository (often referred to as the *Code* section in GitHub).  We use the file repository to list our party's **goals** and **high-level tasks**.

### Goals
The file repository contains a collection of files describing our party's current goals.  Each file represents a category of goals, and within each file, you'll find a list of closely related goals within that category.  For example, the file named [Goals - 2014 Elections](../blob/master/Goals%20-%202014%20Elections.md) contains a list of our goals for the 2014 elections.

These goals are intended to provide purpose and context for the **high-level tasks** listed below the goals.  That is, each listed task should be designed to achieve progress on a specific goal.

### High-level Tasks
Within each file, underneath the list of goals, is a list of high-level tasks that we believe are necessary for achieving the goals. For example, obtaining ballot access for a candidate is a goal, while organizing a signature-drive might be a high-level task for achieving that goal.

These high-level tasks are much too big to be completed by a single person in a reasonable amount of time, and so they are broken down into the much smaller and more manageable tasks found on the [Issues] page.

## Issue List
The [Issues] list is the actual *To-do List*.  It is a list of small, atomic tasks that are based on our goals and high-level tasks, and that are designed to be completable by a single person in a manageable amount of time.
