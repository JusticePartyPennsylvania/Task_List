This is a public task list for people who wish to help build the Justice Party of Pennsylvania.  If you'd like to get started right away, head over to the [Issues] section for a list of our open tasks.  Otherwise, keep reading for an overview of how this repo is organized and how people can contribute.

# Organization
This repository is organized into two sections:  the [File Repository] and the [Issues] list.

## File Repository
The [File Repository] is the primary section of the repository (often referred to as the *Code* section in GitHub).  We use the file repository to list our party's **goals** and **high-level tasks**.

### Goals
The file repository contains a collection of files describing our party's current goals.  Each file represents a category of goals, and within each file, you'll find a list of closely related goals within that category.  For example, the file named [Goals - 2014 Elections](../master/Goals%20-%202014%20Elections.md) contains a list of our goals for the 2014 elections.

These goals are intended to provide purpose and context for the **high-level tasks** listed below the goals.  That is, each listed task should be designed to achieve progress on a specific goal.

### High-level Tasks
Within each file, underneath the list of goals, is a list of high-level tasks that we believe are necessary for achieving the goals. For example, obtaining ballot access for a candidate is a goal, while organizing a signature-drive might be a high-level task for achieving that goal.

These high-level tasks are much too big to be completed by a single person in a reasonable amount of time, and so they are broken down into the much smaller and more manageable tasks found on the [Issues] page.

## Issues List
The [Issues] list is the actual *To-do List*.  It is a list of small, atomic tasks that are based on our goals and high-level tasks.  All tasks in the Issues list are intended to be completable by a single person in a manageable amount of time.

The tasks (issues) in this list are typically grouped into *Milestones*.  Each milestone should correspond with a high-level task or goal described in the file repository.  You can filter the task list based on milestone, which should help you identify tasks that are closely related, and that are possibly dependent on one another.

# How to Contribute
There are three primary ways to contribute to our task list:  [work on a task](#method-one-work-on-a-task), [create new tasks](#method-two-create-new-tasks), or [fork our task list](#method-three-fork-our-task-list).

## Method One: Work on a Task
The best way to help out is to work on a task.  To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the task list (i.e. [Issues] list).
1. *(optional)* Filter the list on a specific milestone (which should correspond with a high-level task or goal).
1. Select a task in the list, and review its description and any comments that may have been added to it.
1. **Work on the task!**
1. Leave new comments on the task describing what you have done:
    * Add notes describing what work you may have completed.  Try to make it easy for a person to verify what you have accomplished or to pick-up where you left off.
    * Leave specific details about the results of the task.  For example, if you completed research, then post the results of your research.
    * Attach information (files, images, hyperlinks, etc.) that may be helpful to a person verifying the task results or continuing the work.
    * Feel free to leave questions if you find something confusing or ambiguous.
1. If you feel the task is completed, then **leave a specific comment asking for the task to be closed**.  One of our project admins will then review your work and close the task if it's ready.

## Method Two: Create New Tasks
Another way to help is to review our goals and high-level tasks in the file repository and create new tasks in the [Issues] list.  When creating new tasks, please follow these guidelines:
* **Each task should be as small as possible.**  The goal is to make it easy for a person to review and complete the task in a manageable amount of time.
* **Provide clear instructions about the expected results of the task**, and consider providing suggestions for completing the task.  We want to make it as easy as possible for new people to begin contributing to our task list.
* **Each task should be designed to make progress on a high-level task or goal.**  Try grouping tasks into new or existing milestones that correspond with the high-level tasks and/or goals in the file repository.

## Method Three: Fork Our Task List
The final way to contribute is to *fork* this repository and improve our list of goals and high-level tasks.  When you're done, make a *pull request* to have your changes integrated back into the main repository.

Review the [README](https://github.com/JusticePartyPennsylvania/Values_Platform/blob/master/README.md) file from our [Values & Platform repository](https://github.com/JusticePartyPennsylvania/Values_Platform) for instructions on forking and making pull requests.
